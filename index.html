                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>“When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”<br>-	Elon Musk</p>
                <p>As a wildly ambitious individual, this quote is an accurate reflection of my philosophy. No matter how outlandish the idea or improbable the chances, if a goal is possible to achieve you strive to pursue it. This is where innovation stems from. I am a recent graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology with a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering and a minor in Electrical Engineering. In my aspirations to understand the higher systems perspective, as well as understand the technical aspects of both hardware and software, I have also attained a Masters of Engineering in Systems Engineering with graduate certificates in Software Engineering, Systems Project Management, and Software Program Management.</p>
                <p>I have a passion for both security and software development, culminating in an intenese interest in the security automation field. I have had experience designing, implementing, and managing a plethora of security automation tools for various platofrms including CloudFlare, AWS, and Azure. With experience developing with the Agile methodology and from a systems persepctive, I am able to iterate code both efficiently and effectively, with a long term and wide vision.</p>
                <p>I have worked for various Fortune 500 companies, including  Johnson & Johnson and General Electric Aviation, and am continuing to pursue other opportunities. Outside of work, I also participate in external competitions such as Innoservice and various hackathons to apply my knowledge in new ways.</p>
